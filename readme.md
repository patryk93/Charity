# Charity

The aim of the project is to create a place where everyone will be able to give away unnecessary things to trusted institutions.

## Where did the idea of the project come from?

The user has things at home that he does not use, but they are in good condition and he wants to give them to people who can use them - but he does not know how to do it easily.

There are many solutions available, but many of them require extra effort or do not inspire confidence. Verified places need to be driven, and there is no time or no way to go there. On the other hand, containers under the house or local collections are unverified and it is not known whether these things will actually go to those in need.
